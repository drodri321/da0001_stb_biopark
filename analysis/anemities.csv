"Parking, toilets, signposted footpaths"
"I feel the University themselves have missed a trick here and if the land is purchased this ought not to be missed again; clearly it will not. The land could generate a significant income with reintroductions and regenerative farming and re-wilding. I do feel most people do not understand these terms and this is critical in winning support for this. The clearer the messaging on the plan, once it is clear, will be vital in raising funds. 

Is it worth exploring business options within the purchase, shareholders, investors etc? The possibilities for, wild-camping, glamping, safaris, history tours in old carriages, walks etc. Using the railway section in a way not used before. Among the beauty of a rewilded, natural thorny scrub, pioneer species, targeted planting - Although not necessary in a rewilding project particularly with precious pennies left to spare- could all co-exist significant money making opportunities.

"I would love to see the original Crab & WInkle railway line developed as a walking or cycle path all the way from Whitstable and Canterbury (and this would include negotiations with the private property owners through whose property the line goes) and potentially re-opening the railway tunnel. It would be great to have a museum dedicated to the Crab & Winkle line at either end of the line, and guided information panels along the line with information about different stops and features (e.g. the Halts where the engines took on water). The museum could also house the original Invicta engine. Guided walks and interactive learning activities for children and school groups could be organised along the old railway line as this will have lower environmental impact. The Crab & Winkle railway is a very important part of Canterbury's history and cultural heritage that currently is completely under-served and unnoticed and much more could be made of the site of the first ever passenger railway in the world and pioneering engineers such as Brunel and Stephenson."
None
Community farming projects.
Enough mentioned.
Can’t think of any more
"Safer pedestrian and cycle access from A290 and from Hackington/Radfall Rds, especially from Blean village and Tyler Hill."
I’d like to understand what commercial activities will be planned to make the park financially viable
"The emphasis, I think, should be not on introducing new activities and amenities, but on protecting and enhancing the site for the activities which are at present enjoyed there."
As much education about nature and wildlife for children
None spring to mind at present
None
Cycle paths
The current plan looks well thought out and planned
"I’d like to see bikes being included in all designs. Meaning I’ve ridden in the woods for 30 odd years as my hobby along with many other local riders, and in the last five I’m receiving increasingly hostile receptions from newcomers to the area. Signage promoting bike riding and making others aware of bikes may reduce increasing confrontations"
None
I think most have been mentioned.
Renewable energy projects?
A cafe perhaps?
Visitors centre
Natural educational activities.
Nature walks for children. Showing them the different trees and plants.
Perhaps more secure areas to protect rare species eg the bison initiative in East Blean
Information points
Organised educational events and walks
"facilities for children, an archaeological and industrial heritage centre, allotments, reforesting,"
A small area designated “Peace” for all to sit and contemplate
Partner with health organisations to run mental wellbeing sessions and therapy in nature. This would increase your funding opportunities and mean you could claim grants from more sources. Growing on the land should be educational as well as helping local people. Perhaps consider how a regenerative agriculture farmer could add value by showing how nature and food production can work together and offer up visits to local schools so they can learn sustainable ways to manage our land. The Save Our Wild Isles documentary on BBC iplayer has a good example of this.
"Regular consultation with. the British Trust for Ornithology to monitor bird population on an annual basis. Request advice from B. T. o on how best to re-wild Blean woods.

Addition of nest boxes for specific endangered species eg. Spotted Flycatcher, Tawny to Owls"
Bike rental
Not sure at the moment
An area for solar panels perhaps.
"A very modest home building scheme.
In particular to see UKC back in business and properly managed."
Information boards
As long as people are allowed are allowed to use it freely it would be enough. If amenities and activities were available it would be a bonus. The main point is people having access to the countryside
"A cafe, specfic spots for picnics, trails for bikes and horses would be lovely, but not at the cost of impacting rewilding. Hopefully a true natural space, with areas for use by the community if possible."
"Forest school, programme of events and arts and craft opportunities for children (similar to brockhill or shorne woods). Orienteering, geocaching. Space for an outdoor theatre for events and bands. Community garden. Outdoor events for birthday parties."
A well resourced and run education centre to teach children the necessity of the natural world; before it disappears!
Information boards. Maintenance of pathways and way marking. It would be lovely to have a visitor centre but this my be in the future
"See above: efforts to combine the various aspects of value imaginatively, and avoid ""silos"", will be very important in ensuring the special character of the woods/setting is preserved"
Forest school. Good pathways and signage
Providing a space where children and schools can have forest school and learning about tile kills and history is a good way of supporting school days out which can be very expensive.
"Regulstbta
Is or activities to encourage people to learn more about the benefits of having such an amenity on their dooestep"
Can’t think of any others
"Habita enhancement, especially along the Sarre Penn"
Visitors' centre
"Integration with Kent Wildlife Trust, with things like information or guides on the local wildlife. Picnic areas and mental-health centered areas/activities. Historical knowledge and teaching spaces"
anything as long as accessibility is considered!
"I think that it is necessary to have adequate rubbish collection points dotted throughout some kind of ""central trail"". This would enable visitors to take the necessary care to keep the park unpolluted and help it to thrive. I also think that in order to capture a wider demographic of the public (and in order to get the University to support this project) it is important to have some kind of restaurant to help bring in money to help maintain the area, whilst also providing access to public toilets. This would have to be situated on the outskirts, in a more accessible area to allow better access to the park rather than people driving through the University. Additionally, there would have to be a small car park for this (but in the same style as the existing pre-school's). In a similar vein, it would be beneficial to somewhere in the park have a childrens playground, but one of those that is made of wood with wood-chip on the floor."
"Heritage Farm days, heavy horses and the plough"
More car parking spaces. Often car parks are full to capacity.
If it was promoted in the right way it could create a new vision for what can be archived in our ever diminishing country side.
None
"Nature trails. Community tree planting - maybe sponsor a tree or plant in the name of a loved one
Butterfly and bird trails and guides"
"cycle paths, but not concrete ones!"
"I think what is suggested is great, not too much development would be preferred by us."
I would love for the park to be carbon neutral - with solar and wind to power any electricity needed
Nothing
Seats for the less able !
You've covered everything
Eco friendly transport from existing city car parks to The Blean for visitors.
Nothing apart from disabled access for enjoyment.
Education centre
Larger circular walks and rides. Prioritised Wildlife and pedestrian crossing points. Wild perimeter buffers. Low impact coppicing and extraction practices. Promotion of green sweet chestnut products in local house building.
Courses to learn rural crafts
N/a
It’s already covered
Dark Skies project
A picnic area would be lovely for families to stop for lunch while exploring the area. And accessible toilets.
Teaching children respect for nature
Picnic areas with overnight sleeping (but not camping)
Anything that benefits the community
A suitable car park. Perhaps a coffee and cake stand so families can go for the day. Rubbish bins so dogwalkers can clear up after their pooches and picnicers can deposit rubbish. More bins less rubbish! Talks on sustainability projects for children in the holidays and on Saturdays so the next generation learns how important our land is.
"Easy access for the disabled, bike paths well delineated"
Children's activities to learn and understand about nature
Regenerative farming
All the above is already excellent
Can’t think of any more
Meditations forest bathing volunteer ops
I cannot think of anything
"I recently went to moors park in Dorset. It is amazing. People flock there, it has huge number of trails, activities (e.g. go ape) playgrounds, it's accessible for people with prams so it's full of families. It was an amazing place to go. I'd love to see something like that here in blean."
This should be predominantly a natural space - protecting nature - not dominated by humans
Horses
No specifics
Maybe a 'go ape' style adventure play. The opportunity for forest school activities.
To be run for everyones inclusion
A safe doggy field.
Allotments. Wild swimming. Foraging.
A warden?
nature trails for kids
Walking with guides to explore the park
well maintained paths that can be comfortably walked all year round
"Designated dog exercise areas, with requirement for dogs to be on leads outside those areas"
Guided walking and cycling trails.
Access to places for picnics and family fun.
"
Maintenance of cycle route"
"A visitor centre would we excellent and help to concentrate visitors to key areas and provide much needed access points into the woods. I would also like to see improved public transport links like bus services as well as more PROWs to improve accessibility, especially for those who may not have vehicles."
"Animal feeders, dog walking poo bins and Mabel bowls"
none
Gardening clubs maybe...nothing trashy....
"Educational walks and talks. Volunteering for people who want to learn more. Bird and Butterfly watching, ecology, soil... just everything that people find interesting."
"Local Craft and Produce Area, Information Points and Signage, Accessible Trails"
Free activities such as regular tai chi or walks which do not ruin the peace of the area.
"Accessibility is already in the list, but more of that. Including accessibility from the financial perspective (public transport, parking fees)"
I like the ones that have been covered in previous questions.
Cafes
"A cafe/food outlet serving sustainable, locally-sourced food and coffee"
"I grew up in Blean and my parents and one remaining grandparent live there. I was married in the church. I spent my childhood walking in the woods and along the salt track. Anything which can celebrate the area, in a way which supports the wildlife and natural beauty of Blean, and provide recreation for those with young families or for the elderly population of the village would be a huge asset to the community."
Baby changing
Nothing in particular
"Art and Sculpture, Historical elements. Environmental awareness prioritised."
"Dedicated spaces for natural worship, events that facilitate closer non-invasive engagement with rarer species, occasional ritualistic sacrifice of humans who threaten destruction of the Blean"
N/A all sounds great
To keep activities as unobtrusive and naturally integrated as possible-walking and bicycle trails
Voluntary habitat restoration projects
Partnership between farming and re-wilding.
"Indigenous species only, engagement activities for local schools and scout groups, bike paths, floor risk management"
"Forest school activities - not just for kids but for adults too. I've always wanted to do something like that. Learn things like bushcraft and survival, learn how to navigate wild areas, how to ID plants and trees and learn which are edible etc. Also community wildlife surveys. Like birds, invertebrates, reptiles, mammals (e.g. bats, badgers, hedgehogs, and many more)."
Ability to hire 'trampers' accessible mobility transport for off road for elderly as they do in Kent Parks eg Shorne Woods so that area could be utilised by all
