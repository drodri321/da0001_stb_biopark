This subdirectory has the following info:

1. The <font color=Green> **main writeup/report** </font> (.pptx) summarising the analysis of the survey.
2. Extracts of text reponses are here (.csvs) which were used to make **wordclouds**.
3. https://www.freewordcloudgenerator.com/generatewordcloud was where we made the wordclouds.
4. Some **working out** for the *initiatives question* and *confidence intervals for the average scores* (working.xlsx).
5. Finally, **where we could go** with more data, and extra routes we could go with this data, but why it wasn't essential (future_opps.docx).
