"A collaborative approach working with 3 local parishes, CCC, UoK, KWT, RSPB, CPRE,"
"Connectivity between our wild spaces. A re-wooded, wetland and rewilded area would provide, in time, significant benefits, economically, educationally and environmentally."
"Increased usage from people, increasing our contact and understanding of the importance natural environments."
Many positives - all the area to be protected and nourished which will in turn nourish and protect many other species and the heritage of this important area
To bring something exciting to the area
All the above
"Obviously it is important to preserve and protect this large area of green space, natural beauty and important cultural heritage and ecological value between three distinct rural villages. This landscape has been largely untouched since Roman times and is of huge cultural significance. I would prefer to focus on using the land to promote greater wildlife connectivity between the East and West Blean woodland complexes, woodland and nature recovery, re-wilding and re-introduction of rare and endangered species. The UK is one of the most nature depleted countries in the world, ranking in the bottom 10% of all countries in the world for biodiversity intactness and only 3% of land in England is really protected for nature. Re-wildling this land and promoting biodiversity and wildlife connectivity with the rest of the Blean wood complex is an extraordinary opportunity. It needs to be very sensitively balanced with promoting greater public access - which should be focused around the sites of cultural heritage, rather than increased public access and high intensity public use (such as cycle and horse paths) to all parts of the land. Farming in the UK has caused huge ecological damage (ripping up hedgerows, intensive use of dangerous chemicals in pesticides and fertilizers, draining peat & wetlands etc.), so unless the farming was low-intensity, nature-friendly farming, it won't help nature recovery on this land."
None
"Protection of biodiversity, heritage, amenity, green space. Also, prevention of highly destructive house-building and road-building projects."
"Even if it is left as it is, it is a positive for humanity. We have to stop the irreversible environmental degradation."
A positive use of the land for the future and fer preferable to building houses
Preservation of valuable natural resource.
Initial initiatives sound wonderful
Improving connectivity between sections of the Blean Woodlands while preserving some natural open space.
Saving nature and biodiversity
It is hugely important to preserve and maintain such areas for the future
A huge increase in public accessibility and creation of semi-natural habitats in place of housing.
A fantastic new asset for the city and surrounding area
Keeping a green space open to all whilst ensuring local food production
"More people enjoying the woods and farmland, escape from the town and City"
All the above initiatives I have ticked are positives. Preserving the land and woodland is a priority. Stopping housing developments is a massive positive.
The preservation of the ancient woodland and hedgerows. And increase in biodiversity with rewilded area's. And we wouldn't get an increase in air pollution from having more houses which in turn means more cars.
Potential as a pilot site to show benefits of sustainable land use. Education and innovation.
"Becoming an important part of the Wilder Blean initiative, currently led by Kent Wildlife Trust"
Attracting visitors by restoring/ rewilding a large area
"Preserving natural and wildlife heritage for all to learn from and enjoy, preserving agricultural land for sustainable food production and education"
Bringing local people together to show a shared love and enjoyment of their surroundings
A great initiative to preserve the area
A safe space to enjoy nature
Preserving environment and history of area
"An opportunity to offer Canterbury its 'green lungs', build community co-operation, educate citizens in the importance of bio-diversity, enhance awareness of food production and maintain the city of Canterbury's environmental, historical and geographical context"
I can’t perceive a negative
Human and nature connection
Increase in all forms of wildlife
Safe space for nature
"Improving heritage awareness and keeping the area for the community, rather than being for people from London. Preserving and enhancing habitat, wildlife and agriculture. Improving well being mental and physical. Involving local people and organisations positively. Rewilding."
"Attracting people to the area - walking trails, information about the wildlife and history"
"None, except for the appointed lawyers remuneration."
Stopping an unnecessary housing development
Outdoor space for people to enjoy and healthy environment for wildlife
"Help saving our Planet, our native species of plants and animals and of course humans ."
We need green space for community as have a lack of local options .new housing development not built
Avoiding the destruction of the environment by excessive housebuilding.
Developing an amazing area and maintaining the diversity and agricultural uses of the land. It was sold to the university for educational uses. It needs to be a green corridor to offset the extensive housing developments particularly in Herne Bay
See above
"Clean air, food production with limited transport. Beauty. Enhancing the wider Blean an area with worldwide importance"
Losing another space to a housing development would be devastating for local people but having a Bio park reinforces how important the environment and nature is to all of us and supports our community in embracing all of the things that are outlined in the plan.
"The opportunity for people to learn about and benefit from their local natural,envirnment"
A community project that develops a unique environment.
No more houses
Preserving an unique natural environment.
"That more of the landscape can be preserved, people from the surrounding villages and universtiy students will have a green space to go to, it could be used for environmental science courses at the uni/nearby colleges and schools as hands-on experience, it would protect the woods and the wildlife from building works"
"Anything that can be done with the Blean to prevent the whims of civilization destroying a piece of ancient civilization is fantastic. Blean Bio Park is a specifically good idea due to how it enhances the qualities of the Blean, and brings out all of its good potential, without transforming the space into something else."
"By re-establishing the woodland areas and re-wilding the area, it would become another area similar to the Blean Woods Nature Reserve. Combined, such a large area could potentially be able to support a far stronger and diverse ecosystem. Aside from the obvious benefits for nature on the whole, it would help make these natural spaces more accessible from those outside of Blean/Rough Common, from the University grounds itself. With the correct planning, this could be a tremendous place."
"All the ideas proposed are great, especially any that protect and enhance the environment. Rewilding,Tree Planting, Farming the land. Cherishing our local heritage."
It will be a large natural recreational area easily accessed from many urbanised areas providing relaxation.
"Ensuring a future for our young, food security and wildlife."
Preservation and mental health
That we don't lose any more precious land and nature to unnecessary housing
More nature.
"If we value the health and vitality of our children, it is important to conserve such spaces"

Preserving green space and biodiversity which can be enjoyed by the people of Canterbury and surrounding district.
Conservation of an area of outstanding natural beauty
Creating a more accessible connected natural environment
"Conserving the natural environment and the opportunity for learning about the area in the past: archaeology, wildlife, rural life and traditional skills."
Many!
All the above
Provided this is not a sop to developers pretending it's BNG
It keeps the heart of the area in tact while allowing development to aid the area instead of yet another area of largely unaffordable housing.
Connecting separate areas of woodland so that nature has more connectivity and more species populations have strong genetic diversity
Health and wellbeing and environment
All positive if it goes ahead
"The positives are endless, keeping nature, a place for families to unwind, a stress free area, a place for the physical and less able members of the community to be in nature close to the city, the possibilities for volunteering to care for the area, a place to love and learn from"
"Saving the trees, land and history for future generations"
"The very existence and survival of trees, open scrub and a pie e of Kent left to enjoy"
Everything to gain and loose!
The possibility to protect the land
All round benefit from enhancing Green space outside the city both for local residents and the environment
Health benefits for the community
Preservation and enhancement of a rare wilderness in southern England
A lovely family space
No house building and protection of nature/wildlife
Ensuring our children have a future
Connecting the university population with local population.
"That this will be a positive venture for the whole community, wildlife and nature."
Establishing an area of biodivsity and to provide an area of leisure for peoples enjoyment and wellbeing.
Adding the Bio Park means we get to keep an area of outstanding beauty.
"People uniting and acting against capitalist greed wanting buildings and profits for this priceless piece of land. People uniting to work for the good of nature, from which we are not separate. Increased oxygen, more habitats for creatures, insects and birds, less pollution and disturbance, more peace and naturalness."
Preserving and enhancing the area for the future
preserving the woodland and bio diversity
Love my wildlife and trees
A place where people can appreciate the natural environment and food production
Recognition that this area is a rare asset of national importance in an area with intensive development pressures
Conserving the area as a place of natural beauty
"As someone who is disabled, this really important to me from a health and wellbeing point of view!!"
Maintenance of valuable natural assets for future generations
"A pioneering collection of stakeholders unifying their resources, land holdings and expertise to create an area that is rich in wildlife and helps to create a connected landscape of rare habitats, allowing the movement of species freely through the woods and surrounding countryside. I also think it will be an incredible opportunity to engage with local communities, reconnecting them with the natural world and how vital it is for us as a society, helping to give us food, water and air security, far into the future. Furthermore, I can see the Bio Park becoming a trip destination for tourists looking to visit the local area, bringing investment and job opportunities to local communities."
Lots; all the above
Some of the above as a green lung for the area but food production should be the priority.
Safeguarding the future for Blean
"As Above: humans need space to relax and feel healthy. To exercise, play and meet ither people and friends"
"Blean Bio Park might offer several potential benefits such as: Biodiversity Enhancement, Ecosystem Restoration, Community Engagement, Economic Opportunities"
That I can’t see any negatives…?
Making Blean more welcoming and accessible for all
More nature which can only be a good thing.
Areas for people to connect with and enjoy the natural environment
"Major environmental and conservation benefits for the land; will draw people to the area and to Canterbury; will attract visitors from further afield, including weekend day-trippers from London etc."
Celebrating the natural beauty and the wildlife of the area. Providing another recreational space for families. Providing a local and accessible space for the elderly community in Blean.
"Accessible nature, maybe used as part of social prescribing"
It would put Canterbury on the map for something other than its World Heritage status (although that's important nonetheless).
Environmental elements prioritised. Community and outdoor elements.
"Investment into wildlife and nature, richer engagement with environment and history, greater incentive to preserve the natural spaces of the Blean"
More accessibility to a wonderful natural space on the edge of the city
Maintaining the wildlife corridor between East and West Blean with habitat restoration and re-wilding considered to be the main priorities
"The restoration and protection of natural habitat with the ensuing recovery of populations of animals and plants that are currently endangered or threatened. Keeping this precious irreplaceable habitat safe and thriving, assuring it will be there for future generations"
An opportunity to safeguard The Blean for current and future generations.
"Stanley ecosystem, opportunity for further species reintroduction, maintenance of a haven't for well-being."
"Community engagement, environmental education, enhanced physical and mental wellbeing, reconnecting people with nature (therefore building bonds that encourage people to protect those natural spaces for both nature and people)."
"Improving Mental health, exercise/wellbeing and sense of community"
