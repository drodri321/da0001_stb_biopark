As wikpiedia reminds us ""the woods form one of the largest areas of ancient woodland in the UK, with parts of it over 1,000 years old."" This extraordinary ecological value combines with its social value as an unspoilt natural resource accessible to large numbers of people due to its proximity to Canterbury and other proximate towns (and villages); its great historical/heritage importance (as recognised in numerous local histories of Kent, and national histories of England, since Chaucerian times); and its extraordinary potential to act as an high profile national exemplar for best practice in land management in relation to landscapes combining ancient woodlands, agricultural activity, and guided leisure/educational endeavour"

The community
We must keep special places like The Blean protected from greedy people who just see money. So many places of importance have been lost because of greed already. The Blean is special for many reasons - mostly personal for me as my family has lived nearby for over 30 years and my children grew up visiting often.

"Its an accessible wild space right next to the city which allows us to just step from the rural built up chaos into a peaceful calm environment. Its good for physical and mental wellbeing, its good for connecting with nature. Its a nice escaoe and its one of few places around here where you can go to just get away from people and all the mess, noise, pollution etc down in the city. Most importantly, its a vital habitat for wildife in a world where habitats are being rapidly depleted for urban expansion. We cant survive without these habitats. Endless growth is unsustainable. There is no economy without ecology."
