Lengthy time frame vs CCC2040 Plan for C12
"The name-not in stone at this point-clearly, but sounds to a countryman/folk like a 'townie' idea of a country park! This needs to be The Blean Conservation or something similar, 'The' being preferntial. This may seemed trivial, semantic or mildly ridiculous, but after the first fight is won, against housing, the next may be against generational farming folk, who are yet to see the benefits of regenerative agriculture, rewilding etc. There is still huge misconceptions surrounding food waste in the UK and land available for agriculture. A bio-park to many would seem a redundant idea, whereas a Conservation and Regenerative area, would not. Semantics, yet maybe an easy win!

Isabella Tree writes extensively about food waste and farming misconception, you will already know this I am certain, and that may be a good starting place.

I also have concerns surrounding the raising of funds. It is possible, it must be successful and you are all superb. However, if everybody in Canterbury alone put £100 into the pot, forget the connotations of this for now, at around £5.5million we would still be some way off. This is not to say it cannot be done; it must and will.

Moreover, I do feel there still needs to be a second pronged attack on the actual housing numbers. Prior to the Lab Gov, the mood was that the figures, ONS based on 2011 Coalition data, were wrong and that Canterbury had exceptional status for a number of reasons, namely a student population of 40,000 and a decreasing population elsewhere. Now this still needs to be challenged and the more noise the better. We may win this battle but the area needs to push back on the figures. While a victory here may lead to 'the build' elsewhere, legally, it should all be re-evaluated, as was discussed with the last gov. In essence, the new devolution may work in our favour: Tony Blair questioning the Scots decisions to not go with him on various points post devolution. Alastair Campbell famously replied 'we did give them the option Tony.' We may yet have an even better ability to fight this all."
It needs to be financially viable to be an attractive alternative to a housing estate for the council.
None - unless it gets built on
Damaging any nature areas and wildlife.
Funding
"I think there is a very delicate balance between protecting nature and wildlife, woodland recovery, re-wildling and re-introduction of new species and promoting greater public access. The more paths (especially higher impact paths like cycle and horse paths)/ family activities/ programme of events/ children's play facilities/ art & sculpture etc. there are, the more risks to protecting nature and wildlife. Wildlife could actually suffer with over-use and public access and activities must be sensitively managed. For example, the bluebell wood in the middle of the site has remained largely untouched and preserved because it is not intensely visited - massively increasing public access to this wood would endanger the bluebells that have existed there for hundreds of years. I think that the sites of cultural heritage (the original Crab & Winkle railway line, the Roman Salt Road and potential archaelogical sites around Blean Church) should be promoted as places to visit and explore, but large parts of the land should be left for nature and wildlife recovery without increased public access and activities. The existing networks of public footpaths and the Crab & Winkle cycle path are already sufficient, although they could be improved (e.g. by removing unnecessarily restrictive fences that farmers have put up)."
How are you going to pay for it - wake up and smell the coffee . It’s a pipe dream and you know it
Not to lose too much agricultural land. Food security is a pressing national concern.
It becomes woke.
"Whether it can


How it will be funded."
Involvement of corporate interests.
Unclear on access plans. Risk that despite intention of initial proposal pressure to make it financially viable may lead to more radical solutions (eg like Betteshanger)
Financial viability - and resisting the predatory behaviour of developers and the current landowners.
Encroachment on the wildlife
None spring to mind at present
It isn't a big enough area to support most wildlife reintroductions.
Litter and anti-social behaviour
Ensuring it is sustainable and financially viable
"Over development of the green spaces, meaning less natural feel to the woodland having too many facilities to hand rather than preserving what’s there already. Any plans to increase traffic will be alarming the roads aren’t fit for greater amount of traffic especially Hackington Road"
None
"Increase in visitors to a fragile area.
Increase in littering etc"
Secure funding into the future.
Too much commercialisation
None
Commercialising to an extent that the landscape is changed irretreivably and not all wildlife would exist there comfortably
If it got too commercial
None at present
None
None
That it is unlikely to be enough to mitigate the university's financial crisis
If it became too touristy
Tourism could increase traffic and litter but this would be manageable if done correctly
It must be allowed to re-wild naturally
"Too pedicured, lots of loud groups"
"I cannot see it is a realistic idea given the cost of buying the land. It will cost money to keep it going - how will this be raised. If KCC and the CCC are supporting the University in keeping financially sound, will they support the idea."
No concerns
Health of the watercourses
Littering and inconsiderate parking
None
"People. Needs strong leadership, good collaboration and communication, with a shared clear vision."
Ensuring a partnership to effectively run it
Could it become a kind of theme park attracting too many people and cars?
The management ongoing and the university’s need for cash at all expense!
"Ensure governance involves appropriate representation beyond powerful landowners and statutory bodies to avoid too narrow, top down agendas and implementation practises. Adopt management practices to ensure it does not become 'disnefied', a 'theme part' and too tightly controlled and partitioned. Provide guidance, but avoid prescription wherever possible."
Funding
My only concern would be how it would be financed.
"On going maintenance to ensure that it grows and develops in the way that is intended, and does not deteriorate over time into a wasteland"
Getting enough support and finance to make the project realistic.
Financial viability
None.
"Regular worries about people littering and being disrespectful, but that is the same with any natural space."
Only getting the plan off the ground
"I would be concerned if it because too commercialised. I understand that the University would need to make some financial benefit from this, but I think this should more be in the form of a catering or restaurant, on the outskirts. This would allow the bulk of the land to become a rich and thriving ecosystem."
That nature and wildlife are first and foremost the priority in saving this land. That every activity that takes place in the area bears this in mind. Knepp Estate seems to manage the tourists well so hopefully the Blean can too.
"The area being continually reduced by urbanisation, the building of houses, shops, supporting infrastructure and increased traffic flows which will destroy the amenity."
There are none as long as if gives the local people freedom to enjoy the country side
None
that there might have to be a compromise on the bio park v's housing and it then becomes piecemeal. We need to save all the land
"That it would become a gated venue with large areas fenced of for wildlife introduction, e..g the Wilder Blean Project."
"That is left as natural as possible, no over development."
Upkeep and maintenance will need to be carefully planned
We need homes
Too many people or activities disturbing the biodiversity
Gradual encroachment
Increase in car traffic from visitors.
A successful biopark could result in more vehicles with the extra people visiting.
Destruction of some of The Blean
Not big enough. Bring in more of Kent’s forests.
Road access to the area if there is going to be a museum or centre
None
That it is too expensive to manage it without consensus across all key partners
Encroachment of mass housing development putting huge pressure on the Blean as the only green space left will ruin it as a space for biodiversity and wildlife as so many people in it every day disturbs the wildlife and samples the vegetation
Ensuring accessible routes with good parking areas for the less abled .
"Too much access by people, this should not be too easily accessible by too many people. People and dogs lead to disturbance, noise, litter, damage to woodlands."
That it would become housing and lost forever
The university wants the money so they will fight tooth and nail to object to it
That it won't happen!
None
Not really any
Becoming woke and not real enough
None
Cost of establishing and maintaining events
Is it sustainable
Finance. Who would pay?
Cost
Too many visitors/cars etc
None
"I'm hoping wildlife preservation shouldn't require cutting off access, free right to roam for at least a large portion of the land is important. If any kind of leisure or activity is planned it should be genuinely community building and working in a participatory accessible manner rather than just expensive sessions for select kinds of people"
"That the organisation might be lacking. This needs professionals and people who are enthusiastic to establish and continue the venture for generations to come. It reminds me of the Victorian era when planning for community parks and spaces was vital for the well-being of the public, they understood that but we have lost our way. This opportunity should not be missed."
none
Too many people can spoil areas whichworries me.
"That the publicly-stated plans for it are honest, not duplicitous. 
That it brings in so many visitors that the good ancient peace and space are disturbed. 
That it becomes commercialised with buildings, shops, loos, tarmac, car parks, wi-fi, instead of being the ancient woodland it deserves to remain."
Commercialisation
no issues at all !
None
commercialisation
Sustaining public engagement and managing feedback will both be expensive
None at present
Get it done quickly
"That the natural beauty of the area would be changed.

"
"A lack of legal protection - would the park be covered by existing land designations such as SSSI, LNRs etc. as I can see the issue of development continuing even if the Bio Park concept is successful."
Not much
Access: if it just becomes a leisure area then the majority of users will use a car. Were it to become a reality then any parking facility should be for disabled users only. Everyone else should walk/cycle.
Too many people can ruin areas designed to enhance it.
Better access for people and children who need wheels to access a site.
"Public Access and Safety, Conflict with Other Land Uses, Funding and Long-Term Sustainability, Ecosystem Management Complexity"
The usual management concerns.
Unsure; I don't know enough about it.
I would like it not to be in construction limbo for years and years.
None
Would want to ensure it is accessible and affordable for visitors
I can’t see any
Constant pressure for houses
"Ironically, it could lead to more traffic as visitors will not all be local, and not everyone will cycle or walk to the park."
None
"Feasibility, influx of destructive visitor/tourist practices that are not effectively offset, more traffic on local roads"
None
Too many cooks might spoil the broth. There need to be clear objectives and agreement on priorities
That its projects interfere and disturb as little as possible the lives of woodland animals and plants who may be adversely affected by human activities
"Provision of parking facilities, and ensuring that wildlife - rather than a wildlife 'theme park' - is a priority."
Overly focused on provision of nature for human enjoyment rather than an attempt to conserve/rewild a traditional habitat to furthest extent possible
"Disturbance to local wild areas - would it increase people traffic? Could it be abused by the wrong crowds (i.e. antisocial behaviour, vandals - how should it be protected to ensure this doesnt happen?)"
Future development - this needs to be a long term commitment
